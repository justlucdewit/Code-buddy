## What is it? 
So you're probably wondering what 'code-buddy' is.

Code-buddy is a automatic project creater. You can use it to create a starting project so you don't need to create all the starting files and link them together

(for example: create a index.html file and a style.css file and link them together and also write a html, head and body tag) why bother doing things over and over again if you can just automate it?

It currently supports: javascript, python, php, bootstrap and html.

## How do i use it?
You first need to download the exe file found in the releases section of this repo. Then you need to add the exe file to your path (explained in the next section) When you have it in your path you can jump into cmd or whatever terminal you use. Then need to navigate to where you want to start your project. When you are in the folder where you store your project you can use the following command:
```bat
code-buddy create [language] [project name]
```
